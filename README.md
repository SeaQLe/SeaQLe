## Hi there 👋



💻 Lately, I’ve been working on a personal project that’s slowly coming together, which has been really fun!

⚙️ I’ve explored web, mobile, data, and DevOps — always curious to try new tools and figure things out.

✨ Always chasing creativity, cool projects, and whatever challenge comes next! 🚀
